        "Styles of Moroccan Berber Rugs\n\n"
       "Handmade rugs and in particular the highly popularised Beni Ourain style,"
        "have seen a steady growth in popularity in homes in the West in recent years."
        "Twentieth-Century vintage Moroccan rugs and newer contemporary styles adorn "
        "many household floors whilst some rugs are hung as wall pieces so that their"
        "artistic attributes can be admired. Their geometric, abstract or tribal designs"
        "can provide a captivating centre piece for any room. Interior designers have been"
        "pairing these rugs with modern interiors to demonstrate how styling vintage with "
        "new as well as traditional with contemporary can work in so many different and exciting ways.\n\n"
        "Despite this more recent regard for the traditionally woven Moroccan Berber rugs,"
        "their incredible history and the different styles of tribal rugs which exist are "
        "lesser known. For us at Cosy Coco, we believe that it is by understanding the story"
        "of these rugs that their true value and beauty can be appreciated. By buying as close "
        "to the source as possible we are often able to offer customers a small glimpse into the "
        "history of their rug and its origins."
